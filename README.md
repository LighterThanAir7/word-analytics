# ByteGrad - Fancy Counter
This is my solution to the Word Analytics project from [ByteGrad](https://bytegrad.com/).

## Overview
A lightweight word analytics app that shows word and character counts, highlights Instagram and Facebook post limits, and includes simple validation to block `<script>` tags and the `@` character for demo purposes.
